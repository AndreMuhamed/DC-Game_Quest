# <a id="сreation"></a>💻 » Creation servers
After successful registration, you will need to create your first server where your bot will be hosted. To do this, go to the [homepage](https://my.nexcord.com/home), where you will find the 'Servers' section.

Once you navigate to this section, you will be prompted to create a new server. You will need to provide it with a name, choose the language in which your bot is written, and then click the 'Create Server' button.

After that, all you have to do is wait approximately 5-10 minutes for the server to be created.

# <a id="sіetting"></a>⚙️ » Setting servers
After creating the [server](https://my.nexcord.com/servers), go to the settings and click on the 'Manage' button. Then log in to your account again.

Next, go to the server settings to set up the bot. The first thing we do is add the bot's code. To do this, go to the 'Files' tab and upload the archive with the bot, which needs to be unpacked. If necessary, you can make changes to the files, modify the code itself, the token, IP address, file name, etc. Don't forget to save the changes!

Then go to the 'Launch' tab and change two things: the 'APP PY FILE' (the file that is launched, i.e., the main file) and 'Additional Python Packages' (list all the libraries used by our bot).

And now we are ready to launch the bot!

# <a id="responsibility"></a>🕵️ » Responsibility
The developers of this Discord bot code strive to create a product that operates as stably and reliably as possible. However, it should be noted that full functionality and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the complexity of interactions with various components and services, as well as the influence of user settings and environments. Users should be prepared for possible failures and changes, so it makes sense to have alternative plans in place to ensure the uninterrupted operation of their projects.

And remember, developers are not responsible for the performance of this Discord bot code
