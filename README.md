### basis.py
This code snippet utilizes the `threading` and `subprocess` modules to concurrently execute multiple Python scripts in separate threads.

1. It defines a function `run_file(file_name)` that launches the specified Python file using `subprocess.Popen(['python', file_name])`. It then prints a message indicating that the file has been launched.

2. It creates a list of files `files` to be executed.

3. For each file in the `files` list, it creates a new thread where the `run_file` function is called with the corresponding file name as an argument.

4. The launched threads are appended to the `threads` list.

5. The main program continues execution without waiting for the threads to complete and prints a message indicating that the Discord bot and other files have been launched.
