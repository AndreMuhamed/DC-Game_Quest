# The provided code is a template for a Discord bot that sends embedded messages (embeds) containing a list of free games available on the Steam platform. Here's an explanation of what it does:

1. It utilizes the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API.
2. The bot includes specific intents, such as `intents.message_content`, enabling it to process message content.
3. A bot object (`commands.Bot`) is created with defined intents and a command prefix of `!`.
4. Upon successful connection to the server (`on_ready` event), it prints "Bot is ready!" to the console.
5. When the command `!халява` (or `!giveaway` in English) is issued, the bot sends an embedded message with a list of free games available on Steam.
6. The embedded message includes information about the games, their respective links, and an explanation that other games can be obtained via the [SteamDB](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/steamdb/kdbmhfkmnlmbkgbabkdealhhbfhlmmon) extension by clicking the "Add free license" button.
7. The bot operates by calling `bot.run()` with your bot's token to authenticate and connect to the Discord API.

This code structure allows the bot to respond to a specific command by sending a detailed list of free Steam games using embedded messages in the Discord channel where the command is invoked.
