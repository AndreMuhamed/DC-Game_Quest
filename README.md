Sure, here's a brief explanation of what this code does:

This code uses the Discord.py library to create a bot that responds to messages. When a user sends a message containing "!давай" (which means "!let's go" in Ukrainian), the bot sends a predefined embedded message to the same channel. The embedded message contains information about joining a gaming community called "Game Room." The message provides details about the application process and includes an icon and a footer with instructions for joining. The bot uses the provided token to authenticate and connect to the Discord server.
