# This code creates a Discord bot that responds to messages and sends embedded messages (embeds). Here is how it works:

1. The bot uses the `discord.py` library to interact with the Discord API.

2. The bot includes certain intents (events to which it will respond), such as `intents.members` (intent for processing events related to server members) and `intents.message_content` (intents for processing message content).

3. A `Client` object is created with the specified intents.

4. Upon successful connection to the server (`on_ready` event), the bot displays the message "Hello! I'm ready to go!" to the console.

5. When a new message is received (`on_message` event), the bot checks if the bot itself is the author of the message. If the author of the message is a bot, then nothing is done.

6. If the content of the message is equal to `!come on`, the bot starts sending an embedded message (embed) from the predefined data structure `backup_message` to the chat.

7. In the `for` loop, the bot iterates through the messages from `backup_message["messages"]` and for each message creates an embedded message based on the data from the message.

8. An embedded message (embed) is created using the `discord.Embed.from_dict()` function, which converts the data from the dictionary into an embedded message object.

9. After creating an embedded message (embed), the bot sends it to the same channel from which the original message was received.

10. The bot is launched using the `client.run()` method, and the bot token is passed as an argument to authenticate and connect to the Discord API.

# <a id="responsibility"></a>üïµÔ∏è ¬ª Responsibility
The developers of this Discord bot code strive to create a product that operates as stably and reliably as possible. However, it should be noted that full functionality and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the complexity of interactions with various components and services, as well as the influence of user settings and environments. Users should be prepared for possible failures and changes, so it makes sense to have alternative plans in place to ensure the uninterrupted operation of their projects.
