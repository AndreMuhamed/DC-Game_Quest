# Sure, let's break down what the code does:

1. Importing Necessary Modules:
   - `discord` and `discord.ext.commands`: These modules provide the functionality to create a Discord bot and handle commands.

2. Defining Intents:
   - An `intents` object is created with intents that determine what events the bot will receive from Discord, such as messages, voice events, etc.
   - `intents.message_content` is set to `True` to allow the bot to see message content.

3. Creating the Bot:
   - A bot object `bot` is created with the prefix `!` and the specified intents.

4. `on_ready` Event:
   - This event is triggered when the bot successfully logs in to the Discord server.
   - It simply outputs the bot's name to the console.

5. Command `!ну`:
   - A custom command named `ну` is created.
   - When this command is invoked, the `send_custom_message` function will be executed.

6. Function `send_custom_message`:
   - Creates a list of dictionaries `custom_embed_data`, each representing an embedded message.
   - For each dictionary in the list, a `discord.Embed` object is created with data from the dictionary.
   - This `discord.Embed` object is used to send an embedded message to the channel from which the command was invoked.

7. Running the Bot:
   - The bot is started using the `run` method, and your bot's token is passed to it.

In summary, when the bot is running and the command `!ну` is entered, the bot will send embedded messages to the channel, with content specified in the `custom_embed_data`. Each embedded message will be created based on the dictionaries in the list, and each of them will be sent to the channel.
