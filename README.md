# The final code I provided you is part of a Discord bot. Here is how it works:

1. The bot uses the `discord.py` library to interact with the Discord API.
2. When launched (`on_ready` event), the bot prints the message "Bot is ready!" to the console to indicate that it has successfully connected to the Discord server.
3. When a message appears on the server, the bot checks its content.
4. If the message contains the text `!go`, the bot starts sending rule sections to the chat as embeds.
5. Each section of the rules is presented as an embedded message (embed) with a title, description, color, margins and footer.
6. The bot first sends one embedded message (embed) with the "Rule - 3.1" header and related fields, and then sequentially sends the remaining embedded messages for the rest of the rules and notes.
7. Each embedded message represents one of the rules, its description, punishment, duration and applicability.
8. After sending all the built-in messages (embeds) representing the rules and a note, the bot ends its work.

The bot uses a `for` loop to loop through and send each embed with the rules and a note to the chat. This allows the bot to consistently present to the user all the rules that have been defined in the code.
