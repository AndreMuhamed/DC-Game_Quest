# The provided code is a template for a Discord bot that sends embedded messages (embeds) containing a list of free games available on the Steam platform. Here's an explanation of what it does:

1. It utilizes the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API.
2. The bot includes specific intents, such as `intents.message_content`, enabling it to process message content.
3. A bot object (`commands.Bot`) is created with defined intents and a command prefix of `!`.
4. Upon successful connection to the server (`on_ready` event), it prints "Bot is ready!" to the console.
5. When the command `!—Ö–∞–ª—è–≤–∞` (or `!giveaway` in English) is issued, the bot sends an embedded message with a list of free games available on Steam.
6. The embedded message includes information about the games, their respective links, and an explanation that other games can be obtained via the [SteamDB](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/steamdb/kdbmhfkmnlmbkgbabkdealhhbfhlmmon) extension by clicking the "Add free license" button.
7. The bot operates by calling `bot.run()` with your bot's token to authenticate and connect to the Discord API.

This code structure allows the bot to respond to a specific command by sending a detailed list of free Steam games using embedded messages in the Discord channel where the command is invoked.

# <a id="responsibility"></a>üïµÔ∏è ¬ª Responsibility
The developers of this Discord bot code strive to create a product that operates as stably and reliably as possible. However, it should be noted that full functionality and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the complexity of interactions with various components and services, as well as the influence of user settings and environments. Users should be prepared for possible failures and changes, so it makes sense to have alternative plans in place to ensure the uninterrupted operation of their projects.
