# This code creates a Discord bot that responds to messages and sends embedded messages (embeds). Here is how it works:

1. Importing Necessary Modules:
   - `discord` and `discord.ext.commands`: These modules provide the functionality to create a Discord bot and handle commands.

2. Defining Intents:
   - An `intents` object is created with intents that determine what events the bot will receive from Discord, such as messages, voice events, etc.
   - `intents.message_content` is set to `True` to allow the bot to see message content.

3. Creating the Bot:
   - A bot object `bot` is created with the prefix `!` and the specified intents.

4. `on_ready` Event:
   - This event is triggered when the bot successfully logs in to the Discord server.
   - It simply outputs the bot's name to the console.

5. Command `!–Ω—É`:
   - A custom command named `–Ω—É` is created.
   - When this command is invoked, the `send_custom_message` function will be executed.

6. Function `send_custom_message`:
   - Creates a list of dictionaries `custom_embed_data`, each representing an embedded message.
   - For each dictionary in the list, a `discord.Embed` object is created with data from the dictionary.
   - This `discord.Embed` object is used to send an embedded message to the channel from which the command was invoked.

7. Running the Bot:
   - The bot is started using the `run` method, and your bot's token is passed to it.

In summary, when the bot is running and the command `!–Ω—É` is entered, the bot will send embedded messages to the channel, with content specified in the `custom_embed_data`. Each embedded message will be created based on the dictionaries in the list, and each of them will be sent to the channel.

# <a id="responsibility"></a>üïµÔ∏è ¬ª Responsibility
The developers of this Discord bot code strive to create a product that operates as stably and reliably as possible. However, it should be noted that full functionality and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the complexity of interactions with various components and services, as well as the influence of user settings and environments. Users should be prepared for possible failures and changes, so it makes sense to have alternative plans in place to ensure the uninterrupted operation of their projects.
