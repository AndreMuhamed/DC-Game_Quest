# This code is designed for a Discord bot that responds to reactions added or removed from a specific message. Here's what it does:

1. `on_raw_reaction_add`: This function is triggered when a user adds a reaction to a specific message. It checks if the reaction was added to a message with a specific ID and verifies if the reaction corresponds to one of the emojis in the `—Ä–µ–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏_–∏_—Ä–æ–ª–∏` dictionary. If the conditions are met:
   - It fetches the server and the user.
   - Finds the corresponding role on the server.
   - Assigns that role to the user on the server.
   - Sends a private message to the user about the successful addition of the role.

2. `on_raw_reaction_remove`: This function is triggered when a user removes a reaction from a specific message. It performs the opposite action compared to `on_raw_reaction_add`:
   - Removes the role from the user on the server.
   - Sends a private message to the user about the successful removal of the role.

These functions are useful for automating the process of assigning or removing roles to users on a Discord server based on reactions to a specific message.

# <a id="responsibility"></a>üïµÔ∏è ¬ª Responsibility
The developers of this Discord bot code strive to create a product that operates as stably and reliably as possible. However, it should be noted that full functionality and reliability cannot be guaranteed due to the complexity of interactions with various components and services, as well as the influence of user settings and environments. Users should be prepared for possible failures and changes, so it makes sense to have alternative plans in place to ensure the uninterrupted operation of their projects.
